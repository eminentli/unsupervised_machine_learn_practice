# 5510 Unsupervised machine learning practice
## Problem Statement

The grocery retail industry is highly competitive and requires companies to constantly innovate and adapt to changing consumer preferences. One way to do this is through customer segmentation analysis, which helps firms better understand their customers and tailor their products and marketing strategies to meet their specific needs.

By using unsupervised machine learning techniques, the grocery firm can identify meaningful customer segments based on similarities and differences in purchasing behavior, demographics, and other relevant variables. Once the segments are identified, the firm can tailor its product offerings and marketing strategies to each segment, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. For instance, instead of wasting resources on marketing efforts to all customers, the company can focus on the specific needs and interests of each segment and create personalized experiences that are more likely to result in incremental sales and customer retention.
